# passport-size-photo-embedder
A bash script to embed a passport sized image file into a 4 x 6 inches canvas for printing. 

### Usage
Ask your friends / family to take a face photo and crop it to the correct ratio. This script will then resize the photo and embed the two copies of it into a 4 by 6 inches image, so that you can print it for a small fee at any local or online photo print services. This way you get to choose a photo you like and not get ripped off by the standard "passport photo" services for a bad photo.

### Dependency
ImageMagick (a free software from http://www.imagemagick.org/)

### Example
passport_photo.sh face_photo.jpg

### License
This script is released under Apache License 2.0, meaning you can use and modify it as you wish.
