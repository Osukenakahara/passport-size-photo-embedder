# passport-size-photo-embedder
A bash script to embed a passport sized image file into a 4 x 6 inches canvas for printing. 

### Usage
Ask your friends / family to take a face photo and crop it to the correct ratio. This script will then resize and embed the two copies of the photos into a 4 by 6 inches image, so that you can print it for a small fee. This way you get to choose a photo you like and not get ripped off by the standard "passport photo" services for a weird face photo.

## Example
passport_photo.sh face_photo.jpg
